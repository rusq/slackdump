*EZ-Login 3000* provides an easy solution to login to Slack without the
complex steps of manually extracting the token and cookies from the
browser.  To use it - just start the Slackdump, and you will be
presented with *EZ-Login 3000* Welcome Screen.  Even scientists can't
explain why it feels so warm and welcoming.

Quickstart
==========

When you start the Slackdump, the EZ-Login 3000 prompt will appear
along with some instructions, asking for the Slack Workspace Name::

  Enter Slack Workspace Name: _

You can paste the URL of your Slack Workspace, or just type in the
name of the workspace.  For example::

  Enter Slack Workspace Name: https://evilcorp.slack.com

OR::

  Enter Slack Workspace Name: evilcorp

Once you press [Enter] (or [Return] on some keyboards), a browser
window will appear, and the given Slack Workspace Login page will
open.

Login the usual way for your workspace (i.e. by entering your email
and password, or using the Single-Sign-On).

When you press the login button, the Slack will start loading the
workspace and then Browser will close automatically and the Slackdump
will be logged in.

How exactly does this work
==========================

EZ-Login 3000 uses the playwright_ framework library to control the
browser instance.  When Slack is authenticated, EZ-Login 3000 waits
for a particular API call, and once it detects that call, it grabs the
token value and session cookies automatically to initialise the
Slackdump Client.

Troubleshooting
===============

The browser disappeared, but Slackdump doesn't do anything.
  Press [Ctrl]+[C] on your keyboard to exit Slackdump and retry
  the login procedure again.  If nothing helps, use the Manual_ login
  method.
