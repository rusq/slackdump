Author: [Danny Adair](github.com/dannyadair)

A script to rewrite file URLs in the Slackdump export.

> Just drop it in the export folder and run it.  It will rewrite the JSON files
> to use a new host/port - I'm just setting it to localhost and run a simple web
> server on the computer running Slackord2 to serve them up.
