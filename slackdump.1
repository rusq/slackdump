The
.Nm
utility dumps Slack workspace contents.  Currently it supports the
following Slack entities:
.Bl -tag -compact -width messages -offset ident
.It Em messages
Includes all messages in all channels, direct, and group messages.
.It Em replies
Includes all message replies or, in other words â€” threads.
.It Em files
Files are dumped along with messages they belong to.
.It Em emojis
Emojis are dumped along with their index which contains their names and aliases
as a JSON file, in the "slow" mode -- includes the user ID of the uploader.
.It Em users
Users includes full profile information without custom fields.
.It Em channels
Channels, that are visible to the current authenticated user.  This includes:
.Bl -dash -compact
.It
current and archive public channels including those that this user is not a
member of;
.It
private group conversations;
.It
direct messages (private conversations between two users).
.El
.It Em search
Searches and saves messages and/or files from the workspace.
.El
.Pp
If no command is given, on a dumb terminal, the 
.Cm help
command is assumed.  On an interactive terminal a list of options will
be presented, allowing the user to enter an interactive mode (wizard),
display help, or exit.
.Sh COMMANDS
The following commands are supported (listed in alphabetical order):
.Bl -tag -width workspace
.It Cm archive

.Ar new
subcommand of the
.Cm workspace
command, run the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Nm Cm workspace Cm help Ar new
.Ed
.It Cm list
List channels or users in the desired format
.Pq default output is text
.It Cm resume
Resume the archive process from the last known point.  This command is useful
when the archive process was interrupted and/or you want to continue from the
point where it was stopped.  It currently supports only the database format.
If you need to resume other formats, such as Slack Export or Dump, you can
use
.Nm Cm convert
command to convert the source to database format and back.
.It Cm search Ar subcommand
Search for messages, files, or both in the workspace and save the results in
archive format.  The discovered files are saved to disk as well.

.El
.\"
.Sh FLAGS
This section lists all available flags, availability of which depends on the
command.  Listed in alphabetical order.
.Bl -tag -width -base dir
.It Fl api-config Ar path
Use the specified API limits configuration TOML file (see the
.Cm config
command).
.It Fl autologin-timeout Ar duration
Headless autologin timeout, without the browser starting time, just the
interaction time. The duration must be specified in the following format:
.Dq XhYmZs ,
for example,
.Dq 1h20m32s
would set the timeout to 1 hour, 20 minutes, 32 seconds.
.Pp
If the flag is not specified, Slackdump defaults to creating a zip file in the
current directory using the following pattern:
.Dq slackdump_YYYYMMDD_HHMISS.zip ,
where
.Dq YYYYMMDD_HHMISS
is the current date and time.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
slackdump_20201231_235959.zip
.Ed
.It Fl browser Ar firefox | chromium
Specifies the browser to use for the authentication.  The default is Firefox.
.It Fl cache-dir Ar path
Specifies the directory where the authentication information and user/channel
cache is stored.  If the flag is not specified, the cache is stored in the
system cache directory.
.It Fl channel-users
If enabled, collects user IDs from the messages and fetches only the users that
are collected from the visible messages, instead of fetching the whole set of
users from the users API.  This is useful when the workspace has a lot of
users.  This method also allows fetching information for external users.
.It Fl cookie Ar cookie | cookie_file
.It Fl env
Enables loading of the environment variables from environment and
.Sy .env,
.Sy .env.txt,
and
.Sy secrets.txt
files.
.It Fl files=true|false
Enables or disables attachment files downloading.  The default is enabled.  To
disable downloading, use
.Dq Fl files=false .
.It Fl log Ar path
Specifies the log file path and or filename.  If the flag is not specified, the
log is written to the error output (STDERR).
.It Fl log-json=true|false
Enables or disables JSON log format.  The default is disabled.
.It Fl machine-id Ar value
Allows to override the machine ID. To read how to use it to transfer the credentials
between machine, run:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Nm Cm help Ar transfer
.Ed
.Pp
See also
.Fl no-encryption
.It Fl member-only
Specify this flag to export only conversations (channels) that the current user
is part of.  Works only if the list of channels/threads is not explicitly
specified.
.It Fl no-encryption
Disables the encryption of cache files and credentials.  Use this option if
you're planning to transfer credentials to another system.  It is highly
recommended to use
.Fl machine-id
flag instead, as it is more secure.
.It Fl no-chunk-cache
Disables caching of chunks for the
.Cm convert
command.  This may be useful on small archives.  For big archives caching is
beneficial, as it allows to reduce the processing time.
.It Fl no-user-cache
Disables caching of users for the subcommands of the
.Cm list
command.
.It Fl o Ar path
Specifies the output directory or zip file where all data will be stored.
If the path ends with
.Dq .zip ,
the data will be stored in the zip file, otherwise
it will be stored in the directory.
.It Fl time-from Ar YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS | YYYY-MM-DD
Allows to specify the start time.  The time is specified in the format
.Dq YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS, or YYYY-MM-DD if only the date is needed.
where
.Sq T
is a literal character separating the date and time, for example
.Dq 2020-12-311T23:59:59
.It Fl time-to Ar YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS | YYYY-MM-DD
Allows to specify the end time.  See the
.Fl time-from
flag for the format.
.It Fl token Ar token
Specifies the token to use for the authentication.  This flag is only used
with the manual authentication methods.
.It Fl trace Ar filename
Enables tracing and writes the trace to the specified file.
.It Fl user-cache-retention Ar duration
Specifies the duration for which the user cache is kept.  The default is
.Dq 1h
.Ns .
The duration is specified in the format accepted by the Go time package.
For example, to specify the duration of 1 hour 30 minutes and 55 seconds, use
.Dq 1h30m55s
.Ns .
.It Fl v
Enables verbose output, prints a lot of debugging information.
.It Fl workspace Ar name
Allows to override the currently selected workspace for the session.
See also the
.Cm workspace Ar select
command.

.Sh USAGE
.Ss Quickstart
The quickest way to get started is to run the following command:
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Authenticate in a new workspace using the
.Cm workspace
.Ar new
command;
.It
Run
.Cm archive
,
.Cm export
or
.Cm dump
, depending on your requirements.  The
.Dq archive
format can be converted to
.Dq export
or
.Dq dump
formats using the
.Cm convert
command.

.Ed
.Sh AUTHENTICATION
Slackdump supports multiple authentication methods listed below.
.Ss Automatic login (EZ-LOGIN 3000)
This is the default authentication mode, and so far is the most convenient one.
It requires no additional configuration and works out of the box.  However, it
is not supported on all systems:  it requires GUI and x64 architecture, and may
require some additional steps on CentOS and other Redhat derived systems.

If the automatic login does not work for some reason, you can try to use one of
the manual login methods, described in the next section.

This method works on Single-Sign-On enabled workspaces as well in most cases.

For Google Authentication, you must use the "User Browser" login method to
avoid bot detection algorithms.

.Ss Manual login methods
.Bl -tag -width token+cookie
.It Em token
This method requires Application
.Pq xapp-
, Bot
.Pq xoxb-
or a Legacy
.Pq xoxp-
token. You can get these tokens (except Legacy) from the Slack
Workspace Administration page.  See the
.Lk https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types "Slack documentation"
for more details.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
You will not be able to access your DMs with the Application or Bot tokens, and
Legacy tokens are deprecated.
.It Em token+cookie
This is the pair of the Client Token
.Pq xoxc-
and a 
.Dq d=
Browser Cookie
.Pq xoxd=
value that you can get from your browser manually following the instructions in
the documentation.
.It Em token+cookie file
This is the same as above, but it requires the 
.Dq cookie.txt
file, exported from you Browser session in Mozilla format.  On Firefox, you could use
.Lk https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/ "Cookies.txt"
extension.
.Sy Note:
Some browser extensions may be unsafe and may expose your private data, so use them at
your own risk.  The authors of this utility do not endorse any of the
extensions mentioned above.
.El
.Pp
If you desire to use
.Ev SLACK_TOKEN
and
.Ev SLACK_COOKIE
environment variables, use
.Nm Cm workspace Cm import.
