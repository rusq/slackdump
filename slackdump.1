.Sh FLAGS
This section lists all available flags, availability of which depends on the
command.  The flags are listed in alphabetical order.
.Bl -tag -width -base dir
.It Fl api-config Ar path
Use the specified API limits configuration file (see the
.Cm config
command).
.It Fl base Ar path
Specifies the base directory or zip file where all data will be stored.
If the path ends with
.Dq .zip ,
the data will be stored in the zip file, otherwise
it will be stored in the directory.
.Pp
If the flag is not specified, Slackdump defaults to creating a zip file in the
current directory using the following pattern:
.Dq slackdump_YYYYMMDD_HHMISS.zip ,
where
.Dq YYYYMMDD_HHMISS
is the current date and time.  For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
slackdump_20201231_235959.zip
.Ed
.It Fl browser Ar firefox | chromium
Specifies the browser to use for the authentication.  The default is Firefox.
.It Fl cache-dir Ar path
Specifies the directory where the authentication information and user/channel
cache is stored.  If the flag is not specified, the cache is stored in the
system cache directory.
.It Fl cookie Ar cookie | cookie_file
.It Fl files=true|false
Enables or disables attachment files downloading.  The default is enabled.  To
disable downloading, use
.Dq Fl files=false .
.It Fl log Ar path
Specifies the log file path.  If the flag is not specified, the log is written
to the standard output.
.It Fl token Ar token
Specifies the token to use for the authentication.  This flag is only used
with the manual authentication methods.
.It Fl no-user-cache
Disables caching of users for the subcommands of the
.Cm list
command.
.It Fl no-chunk-cache
Disables caching of chunks for the
.Cm convert
command.  This may be useful on small archives.  For big archives caching is
beneficial, as it allows to reduce the processing time.
.It Fl time-from Ar YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS
Allows to specify the start time.  The time is specified in the format
.Dq YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS
where
.Sq T
is a literal character separating the date and time, for example
.Dq 2020-12-311T23:59:59
.It Fl time-to Ar YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MI:SS
Allows to specify the end time.  See the
.Fl time-from
flag for the format.
.It Fl trace Ar filename
Enables tracing and writes the trace to the specified file.
.It Fl user-cache-retention Ar duration
Specifies the duration for which the user cache is kept.  The default is
.Dq 1h
.Ns .
The duration is specified in the format accepted by the Go time package.
For example, to specify the duration of 1 hour 30 minutes and 55 seconds, use
.Dq 1h30m55s
.Ns .
.It Fl v
Enables verbose output, prints a lot of debugging information.
.It Fl workspace Ar name
Allows to override the currently selected workspace for the session.
See also the
.Cm auth Ar select
command.

.\"
.Sh USAGE
.Ss Quickstart
The quickest way to get started is to run the following command:
.Bl -enum -compact
.It
Authenticate in a new workspace using the
.Cm auth
.Ar new
command;
.It
Run
.Cm dump
,
.Cm archive
or
.Cm export
, depending on your requirements.
.El
.Sh AUTHENTICATION
Slackdump supports multiple authentication methods, listed below.
.Ss Automatic login (EZ-LOGIN 3000)
This is the default authentication mode, and so far is the most convenient one.
It requires no additional configuration and works out of the box.  However, it
is not supported on all systems:  it requires GUI and x64 architecture, and may
require some additional steps on CentOS and other Redhat derived systems.

If the automatic login does not work for some reason, you can try to use one of
the manual login methods, described in the next section.

This method works on Single-Sign-On enabled workspaces as well in most cases.
.Ss Manual login methods
.Bl -tag -width token+cookie
.It Em token
This method requires Application
.Pq xoxa-
, Bot
.Pq xoxb-
or a Legacy
.Pq xoxp-
token. You can get these tokens (except Legacy) from the Slack
Workspace Administration page.  See the
.Lk https://api.slack.com/authentication/token-types "Slack documentation"
for more details.
.Pp
.Sy Note:
You will not be able to access your DMs with the Application or Bot tokens, and
Legacy tokens are deprecated.
.It Em token+cookie
This is the pair of the Client Token
.Pq xoxc-
and a 
.Dq d=
Browser Cookie
.Pq xoxd=
value that you can get from your browser manually following the instructions in
the documentation.
.It Em token+cookie file
This is the same as above, but it requires the 
.Dq cookie.txt
file, exported from you Browser session in Mozilla format.  On Firefox, you could use
.Lk https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookies-txt/ "Cookies.txt"
extension.
.Sy Note:
Some browser extensions may be unsafe and may expose your private data, so use them at
your own risk.  The authors of this utility do not endorse any of the
extensions mentioned above.
