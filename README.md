> [!WARNING]
> # Enterprise Workspaces Security Alerts
>
> Depending on your Slack plan and security settings, using Slackdump may

## Description

Typical use scenarios:

* archive your private conversations from Slack when the administrator
  does not allow you to install applications OR you don't want to use
  potentially privacy-violating third-party tools,
* archive channels from Slack when you're on a free "no archive" subscription,
  so you don't lose valuable knowledge in those channels,
* create a Slack Export archive without admin access, or
* save your favourite emojis.

There are several modes of operation

1. List users/channels
1. Dumping messages and threads
1. Creating a Slack Export in Mattermost or Standard modes.
1. Creating an Archive
1. Emoji download mode.
1. Viewing export, dump or archive files or directories (displays images).
1. Search mode (messages and files).

Run `slackdump help` to see all available options:

## Installation and Quickstart

On macOS, you can install Slackdump with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install slackdump
```

On other Operating Systems, please follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release for your operating system from the [releases] page.
1. Unpack the archive to any directory.
1. Run the `./slackdump` or `slackdump.exe` executable (see note below).
1. You know the drill:  use arrow keys to select the menu item, and Enter (or
   Return) to confirm.
1. Follow these [quickstart instructions][man-quickstart].

[releases]: https://github.com/rusq/slackdump/releases/

> [!NOTE] 
> On Windows and macOS you may be presented with "Unknown developer" window,
> this is fine.  Reason for this is that the executable hasn't been signed by
> the developer certificate.

  To work around this:

  - **on Windows**: click "more information", and press "Run
    Anyway" button.
  - **on macOS** 14 Sonoma and prior:  open the folder in Finder, hold Option
    and double click the executable, choose Run.
  - **on macOS** 15 Sequoia and later:  start the slackdump, OS will show the
    "Unknown developer" window, then go to System Preferences -> Security and
    Privacy -> General, and press "Open Anyway" button.

## Running Slackdump from a Repo Checkout

If you've cloned the repository and want to run slackdump directly without downloading a release, you can do one of the following:

1. **Build and run** (creates an executable):
   ```shell
   go build -o slackdump ./cmd/slackdump
   ./slackdump wiz
   ```

2. **Run directly**:
   ```shell
   go run ./cmd/slackdump wiz
   ```

Note: You need Go installed on your system (see `go.mod` for the version)


## Slackord2: Migrating to Discord

If you're migrating to Discord, the recommended way is to use
[Slackord2](https://github.com/thomasloupe/Slackord2) — a great tool with a
nice GUI, that is compatible with the export files generated by Slackdump.

## User Guide

For more advanced features and instructions, please see the [User Guide][ug],
and read `slackdump help` pages.

# Previewing Results

Once the workspace data is dumped, you can run built-in viewer:

```shell
slackdump view <zip or directory>
```

The built-in viewer supports all types of dumps:

1. Slackdump Archive format;
1. Standard and Mattermost Slack Export;
1. Dump mode files
  
The built-in viewer is experimental, any contributions to make it better looking are welcome.

Alternatively, you can use one of the following tools to preview the
export results:

- [SlackLogViewer] - a fast and powerful Slack Export viewer written in C++, works on Export files (images won't be displayed, unless you used an export token flag).
- [Slackdump2Html] - a great Python application that converts Slack Dump to a
  static browsable HTML.  It works on Dump mode files.
- [slack export viewer][slack-export-viewer] - Slack Export Viewer is a well known viewer for
  slack export files. Supports displaying files if saved in the "Standard" file mode.

## Using as a library

Download:

```shell
go get github.com/rusq/slackdump/v3
```


### Example

```go
package main

import (
  "context"
  "log"

  "github.com/rusq/slackdump/v2"
  "github.com/rusq/slackdump/v2/auth"
)

func main() {
  provider, err := auth.NewValueAuth("xoxc-...", "xoxd-...")
  if err != nil {
      log.Print(err)
      return
  }
  sd, err := slackdump.New(context.Background(), provider)
  if err != nil {
      log.Print(err)
      return
  }
  _ = sd
}
```

See [Package Documentation][godoc].

### Using Custom Logger
Slackdump uses a "log/slog" package, it defaults to "slog.Default()".  Set the
default slog logger to the one you want to use.

If you were using `logger.Silent` before, you would need to
[implement][slog-handler-guide] a discarding [Handler][godoc-slog-handler] for slog.

[godoc-slog-handler]: https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog#Handler

## FAQ

#### Do I need to create a Slack application?

No, you don't.  Just run the application and EZ-Login 3000 will take
care of the authentication or, alternatively, grab that token and
cookie from the browser Slack session.  See [User's Guide][ug].

#### I'm getting "invalid_auth" error

Run `slackdump workspace new <name or url>` to reauthenticate.

#### How to read the export file?

```shell
slackdump view <ZIP-archive or directory>
```

#### My Slack Workspace is on the Free plan.  Can I get data older than 90-days?

No, unfortunately you can't.  Slack doesn't allow to export data older than 90
days for free workspaces, the API does not return any data before 90 days for
workspaces on the Free plan.

#### What's the difference between "archive", "export" and "dump"?

"Archive" is the new format introduced in v3, it minimises the memory use
while scraping the data and also has a universal structure that can be
converted into export and dump formats at will by using the "convert" command.

"Export" format aims to replicate the files generated when exporting a Slack
workspace for compatibility.

"Dump" format has one channel per file, there's no workspace information nor
any users stored.  Should it be required, one must get users and channels by
running `slackdump list` command.

Behind the scenes slackdump always uses the "archive" file format for all
operations except "emoji" and "list", and converts to other formats on the
fly, removing the temporary archive files afterwards.
